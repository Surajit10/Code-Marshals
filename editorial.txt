Explanation : 

The simple approach to solve this problem would be something like this:

we would create a map where key --> username and value -- > (number of times the username was previously requested)


Whenever a username is requested we would first check whether (map[username] == 0) if Yes print "Done!"
and then increment the count i.e (map[username]++) 

But if the map[username]!=0 we would simply print username appended by count i.e username + to_string(map[username]) and then increment the count

for eg : 

Input:

2
surajit
surajit

Output:

Done!
surajit1


Time Complexity: O(n)



Code:

C++ Code:

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int n;
    cin >> n;

    map<string, int> m;
    
    while (n--)
    {
        string s;
        cin >> s;
 
        if (m[s] == 0)
        {
            cout << "Done!" << endl;
            m[s]++;
        }
        else
        {
            cout << s + to_string(m[s]) << endl;
            m[s]++;
        }
    }
}
